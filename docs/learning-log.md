# Learning log

Short notes on what I learned and what went wrong, newest first. Used as evidence for the report.

## KAN-20: Per-person split with largest remainder

- **The problem:** splitting cents by ratio gives fractions (Chee's exact share is 719.39¢). Rounding everyone normally can make the total 1¢ off the receipt.
- **Largest remainder:** floor everyone's exact share, count the cents left over, then give one extra cent each to the people with the biggest fractional parts. Ties go to the smaller participant ID so the answer never changes between runs.
- **Worked example (the brief):** exact totals 719.39 / 899.24 / 959.19 / 959.19 → floors add to 3536 → 1¢ left → Chee has the largest fraction (.39) → **720 / 899 / 959 / 959 = 3537**.
- **No floats:** each person's exact subtotal is stored as a whole number by multiplying by the least common multiple of every item's total shares (Tiger shared 1:1 → ×2). Fractions are then compared as integer remainders.
- **Design choice:** the ticket rounds each person's total once. I round items, service and GST separately with the same helper, so each person's three parts always add up to their total and none can come out as -1¢. On the brief's bill both methods give the same answer.
- Unclaimed items go to the bill owner and are reported as `unclaimedCents` so the app can warn.
- Checked with 21 unit tests plus a throwaway stress test of 5,000 random bills: every total matched the receipt.

## KAN-19: SG service charge then GST (TDD)

- **TDD:** wrote 10 tests first against a stub that throws, saw all 10 fail (red), then wrote the code until they passed (green). The two commits are kept separate on the PR so the order is visible.
- **Order matters:** service is charged on the subtotal, then GST on subtotal + service. On the brief's bill (2950) that gives 295 + 292 = 3537. Charging GST on the subtotal alone would give 266 and the wrong total.
- **Rounding with integers only:** `Math.floor((amount * bp + 5000) / 10000)` rounds half up without floats. Adding half of 10000 before dividing is what turns `floor` into "round half up". Example: 3245 × 900 = 2,920,500 → 292.
- **Guard clauses:** negative or decimal inputs throw a `RangeError` so a bad value can never quietly produce a wrong bill.
- Split code coverage: 100% lines and branches.

## KAN-18: Prisma + Postgres in Docker

- Docker Desktop needed the Windows "Virtual Machine Platform" feature. `wsl --install` failed with `Forbidden (403)` because it tries to download Ubuntu; `wsl --install --no-distribution` (or enabling the feature with `dism`) fixed it.
- Port 5432 was already used by a Postgres 18 I had installed on Windows, so the Docker database runs on 5433.
- Prisma 7 is different from older tutorials: it needs `prisma.config.ts` and a driver adapter (`@prisma/adapter-pg`), and `migrate dev` no longer generates the client. I added `postinstall: prisma generate` so `npm ci` (and CI) always generates it.
- Local (Docker) and production (Amazon RDS) both use Postgres 18 so behaviour matches (dev/prod parity).

## KAN-17: Protect main

- The ruleset was set up correctly but **not enforced**: GitHub only enforces rulesets on private repos with a paid plan. A direct push to `main` went through. After making the repo public, the same push was rejected with `GH013: Changes must be made through a pull request`.
- Auto-delete of merged branches only applies to PRs merged after the setting is turned on.

## KAN-16: CI workflow

- oxlint reports some rules (e.g. `no-debugger`) as **warnings**, which exit 0, so a PR with lint problems would still be green. Found this by adding a `debugger;` on purpose. Fixed with `oxlint --deny-warnings`.
- A PR follows its branch: pushing a fix to the same branch updates the open PR and re-runs CI.

## KAN-15: Monorepo

- Nest CLI v12 and the current Vite template set up **oxlint and Vitest** instead of ESLint and Jest. I kept the generated tools.
- `README.md` had been saved as UTF-16, so git treated it as a binary file. Converted it to UTF-8; VS Code kept showing it garbled until the tab was reopened.
- Squash merge uses the PR title as the commit message, so the PR title must start with the Jira key.
